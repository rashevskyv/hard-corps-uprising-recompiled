# Saves and settings: the portable `user_data` folder

Everything the port writes for the player lives in one folder, `user_data`, next to the program.

```
HardCorpsUprising\
    hard_corps_uprising.exe
    hard_corps_uprising.toml
    game\
    logs\
    user_data\
        settings.toml           launcher choices
        58410A18\
            live\               local scores and offline leaderboards (stats.toml)
        0000000000000000\
            58410A18\           installed DLC
        achievements\           unlocked achievements (58410A18.toml)
        cache\                  ReXGlue's shader cache
```

The layout inside `user_data` is ReXGlue's own, unchanged: only its root moved. Copying the whole program folder to
another PC carries saves, scores, achievements, DLC and settings with it. `user_data` is created the first time it is
needed and is never part of a release download. `game` stays separate and is not player data. Logs stay in `logs` next to
the program (in `user_data\logs` only when an AppImage's folder is not writable).

## Where the folder is

| System | `user_data` is in |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | the folder that holds `hard_corps_uprising.exe` |
| Linux AppImage | the folder that holds the AppImage file (never inside its read-only mount) |
| Linux, outside an AppImage | the folder that holds the program |

This is the same folder as `game` and `logs` (`PortFolder()` in `src/platform.cpp`). `--user_data_root=<folder>` wins
over everything: that folder is used as it is, nothing is migrated and `user_data` is not created.
`tools\build.ps1 -Run` passes it to keep a development profile in `build\user_data`. `--cache_root` likewise keeps the
cache where it names; without it the cache follows the user data root (`<user data>\cache`).

The About page's **Saves and settings** row opens the folder in use and says which one it is.

## Upgrading from v0.3.1 or earlier

Those versions kept this data in the system's user folder (ReXGlue's default user data root):

| System | Previous folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `Documents\hard_corps_uprising` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hard_corps_uprising`, normally `~/.local/share/hard_corps_uprising` |

The first start of a newer version **moves** that folder into `user_data` before anything reads or writes it, in this
order (`SelectUserData` in `src/user_data.cpp`):

1. If `user_data` does not exist (or holds no files, only empty folders) and the old folder holds files, rename the old
   folder to `user_data`.
2. If the rename is not possible, for example because Documents and the game are on different drives, copy the old
   folder into `user_data.migrating` next to `user_data`, check that the copy has the same folders and files with the
   same sizes, then rename it to `user_data`.
3. Only then remove the old folder.

If any step fails, the old folder is left as it was, no partial `user_data` is ever active, `user_data.migrating` is
removed, the old folder is used for that run, one warning is logged, and the move is tried again at the next start. If
only removing the old folder fails, `user_data` is used and the log says the old folder remains.

| Situation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No old data, no `user_data` | `user_data` is created and used |
| Old data, no `user_data` (or an empty one) | old data moves in, as above |
| `user_data` and the old folder both hold data | `user_data` is used; the old folder is neither merged nor deleted; one warning |
| `user_data` cannot be created or written | the system folder is used for that run; one warning |
| `--user_data_root` given | that folder is used, nothing moves |

The log carries one `User data:` line for each start.

## Updating

Extract a newer ZIP over the old folder, or move `user_data` (and `game`) into the new folder. Deleting the old program
folder deletes `user_data` with it.

## Packaging

`tools\package-release.ps1` and `tools\package-linux.sh` reject `user_data` and `user_data.migrating`, along with
`cache`, `logs`, `58410A18`, `settings.toml`, game files and save or log file types.

## Tests

`tests\user_data_tests.cpp` (target `hcu_user_data_tests`) covers choosing the root, the move by rename and by copy, the
collision and empty-folder rules, failures at each step, the fallback and the `--user_data_root` precedence, using
temporary folders only. `tools\test-release-check.ps1` checks on scratch folders that the release check accepts a fresh
extraction and refuses `user_data`, its contents, `user_data.migrating`, `cache`, logs and game files.
