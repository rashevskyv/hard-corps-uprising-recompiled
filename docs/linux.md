# Linux and Steam Deck

> **Experimental.** The Linux build is a native x86_64 program, not a Windows build under Proton or Wine. It is
> compiled and packaged. A SteamOS tester has run it, but it has not been broadly tested on real Linux PCs or Steam Deck
> hardware. Reports are welcome.

The Linux build uses the same code as the Windows build: ReXGlue SDK 0.10.0's Linux runtime and the Xenos GPU
plugin's Vulkan backend, both built with the project's patches, and the same TRG launcher. It ships as one
AppImage, which is also the Steam Deck build.

v0.5.0 fixes three problems that showed on Linux: incorrect texture brightness in the Vulkan renderer, which could
darken images and lose glow effects (Windows was not affected); Exit Game hangs (reported from SteamOS Game Mode) and
shutdown crashes; and a Vulkan presenter that rebuilt its output pipeline, waiting for the GPU, on every frame. The
brightness fix has not been confirmed on a real Linux PC or Steam Deck yet.

v0.6.0 adds Aspect Ratio and Internal render resolution, shared with the Windows graphics work. The AppImage builds and
the automated tests pass, but the Vulkan reduced-resolution path has not been tested in real gameplay on a Linux GPU or
Steam Deck. The graphics card selection is Windows only.

v0.6.1 fixes the AppImage not starting where the system cannot mount it with FUSE, as reported from Steam's Beta client
on SteamOS: it now unpacks itself and runs from there
([Steam Beta and the AppImage](#steam-beta-and-the-appimage)). Where FUSE works nothing changes. The fix is verified in a
test environment that blocks FUSE; it is not confirmed on SteamOS yet.

## Requirements

- 64-bit x86 Linux (x86_64) with glibc 2.31 or newer, such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later (`ldd --version` shows it)
- A Vulkan driver (Mesa RADV on a Steam Deck and most AMD and Intel PCs)
- An X11 or Wayland desktop (the runtime loads `libX11`, `libX11-xcb`, `libxcb` and `libwayland-client`)
- `zenity` or `kdialog` for the package picker, and `xdg-open` for the About page's folder buttons
- Your own Hard Corps: Uprising Xbox Live Arcade package (see the README for the exact version)

The AppImage carries the C++ runtime of its build machine (GCC 13 or newer). It is used only when the system's own copy
is older than GCC 13.

## Installing

1. Download **HardCorpsUprisingRecompiled-v…-x86_64.AppImage** and put it in a folder you can write to.
2. Make it executable: right-click it > **Properties** > **Permissions** > **Is executable**, or
   `chmod +x HardCorpsUprisingRecompiled-v*-x86_64.AppImage`.
3. Run it. The launcher opens.
4. On the **Play** page click **Install from package...** and pick your package. The game files are copied into a
   `game` folder next to the AppImage.
5. Press **PLAY**.

### Steam Deck

This is the intended flow. A SteamOS tester on a Legion Go 2 reports that it runs from Steam's stable client, but it has
not been tried on a Steam Deck itself.

1. In **Desktop Mode**, do steps 1 to 5 above. Copy your package to the Deck first (USB stick, SD card or network).
2. In Steam: **Games** > **Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library**, and pick the AppImage.
3. Return to **Game Mode** and start it from your library.

Use the touchscreen or the trackpads in the launcher. A controller's **Start** button presses Play, and the D-pad,
left stick, A and B move through the launcher.

### Steam Beta and the AppImage

An AppImage mounts itself with FUSE before any of its own code runs. On Steam's Beta client, a non-Steam AppImage can be
started where that mount is not possible, in Game Mode and in Desktop Mode alike. It then stops at once, Steam's log shows
"Cannot mount AppImage, please check your FUSE setup.", and the game writes no log because it never starts, while the same
file started from a file manager works. Other AppImages are reported to fail the same way
([ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux#13736](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/13736)).

Since v0.6.1 the AppImage deals with this itself, with nothing to set in Steam. Its runtime still tries the FUSE mount
first. If the mount cannot be made, it unpacks the AppImage into a private folder under `/tmp` (about 70 MB), runs the game
from there with the same arguments, returns the game's exit status and removes the folder afterwards. A restart of the game
from the launcher starts the original AppImage again and goes through the same steps. Where FUSE works, the AppImage is
mounted as before and nothing is unpacked. Only a failed mount triggers this: a damaged AppImage is still reported as
damaged. `game`, `logs` and `user_data` stay next to the AppImage in both cases.

Verified in a test environment that blocks FUSE (an unprivileged user namespace, where the runtime prints the same
"No suitable fusermount binary found" lines as in Steam's log), not yet on SteamOS. In that case a line such as
`Error: $FUSERMOUNT_PROG not set` can still appear in the terminal or Steam's log; it is expected and harmless.

If an AppImage still does not start from Steam, open the game's Steam **Properties**, set **Launch Options** to

```
APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 %command%
```

and tell us whether that changes anything. It makes the runtime unpack the AppImage without trying FUSE at all
(`%command% --appimage-extract-and-run` does the same).

## Where things are

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Game files | `game` next to the AppImage |
| Logs | `logs` next to the AppImage (`~/.local/share/hard_corps_uprising/logs` if that folder is not writable) |
| Settings, saves, shader cache | `user_data` next to the AppImage ([user-data.md](user-data.md)) |

Earlier versions used ReXGlue's own Linux location, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hard_corps_uprising`; its contents move into
`user_data` at the first start. A build run outside an AppImage keeps `game`, `logs` and `user_data` next to the program instead. `--game_data_root` and `--user_data_root` override the folders, as on Windows.

- **Window icon.** The program sets its window icon from the AppImage's own icon file, so it does not depend on the
  AppImage being integrated into the desktop. A build run outside an AppImage keeps the desktop's default icon.
- **Application ID.** The program tells the desktop it is `io.github.saulob.hard-corps-uprising` (the Wayland
  app_id and the X11 window class). The `.desktop` file in `packaging/linux` has the same name and sets it as
  `StartupWMClass`, and `tools/package-linux.sh` stops if they differ.

## Known limits

- Not broadly tested on real hardware: rendering, audio, controllers and performance are largely unconfirmed.
- Holding **Shift** to bring the launcher back works only if the window gets keyboard focus while Shift is still
  held, because SDL cannot read the keyboard before the window has focus. Keep Shift held until the launcher appears.
- The VSync setting maps to Vulkan's present mode: **Off** allows immediate presentation (tearing), **On** uses
  mailbox or FIFO.
- On a Wayland desktop with display scaling above 100%, window sizes can come out larger than chosen. ReXGlue
  sizes its window this way on Linux.

## Building the AppImage

Run on Linux or WSL, from a clone with the TRG launcher submodule, after `tools/codegen.ps1` has generated
`generated/default` and with your own `game/extracted/default.xex`:

```sh
tools/package-linux.sh            # incremental Release build, then package
tools/package-linux.sh --clean    # clean Release build first
```

It needs `clang-20`, `clang++-20`, `lld-20` (the game links with ThinLTO), CMake 3.25+, Ninja, rsync, wget or curl,
unzip or python3, binutils, the GCC 13 or newer C++ runtime and headers, and the X11/Wayland client libraries
(`libx11-6`, `libx11-xcb1`, `libxcb1`, `libwayland-client0`), which the SDK's `rexglue` code generator loads.

The AppImage needs the glibc of the machine that built it, so releases are built on Ubuntu 20.04 (glibc 2.31). The
script warns when the build machine's glibc is newer and stops if any packaged library needs more than 2.31.
`tools/setup-linux-build-env.sh` prepares a clean Ubuntu 20.04 machine for it, as root: clang 20 from
[apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org), the GCC 13 runtime from the `ubuntu-toolchain-r/test` PPA, CMake 3.31.8 and the
SDK's build dependencies. libdecor 0.2.2 and PipeWire 0.3.48 are not packaged for 20.04, so the script builds them
from their pinned commits into `/usr/local`; SDL loads both at run time and needs only their headers to build the
Wayland decoration and PipeWire audio backends, so the AppImage does not carry them. To make the environment in WSL:

```sh
wsl --import HcuFocalBuild <folder> ubuntu-base-20.04.5-base-amd64.tar.gz
wsl -d HcuFocalBuild -u root -- bash tools/setup-linux-build-env.sh
```

The base image is `ubuntu-base-20.04.5-base-amd64.tar.gz` from cdimage.ubuntu.com (SHA-256
`60e216b60947653dc8989be3821380268315b99b2959c29882781541bfe5a426`); a Docker `ubuntu:20.04` container works the same
way. The SDK's stock `rexglue` tool needs glibc 2.35, so `tools/package-linux.sh` builds it from the patched source on
this baseline.

The script copies the sources to `~/hcu-linux-build` (set `HCU_WORK` to change it), downloads the pinned ReXGlue
SDK and appimagetool with their SHA-256 checks, builds the project's patched ReXGlue runtime and
Vulkan GPU plugin from source the first time and whenever the patches change
([docs/rexglue-runtime-patch.md](rexglue-runtime-patch.md) lists the extra packages and the network access this
needs), builds the AppImage runtime (below), builds the `linux-amd64-release` preset, checks
that the AppDir holds no game files, packages, saves, logs or local paths, and writes
`dist/HardCorpsUprisingRecompiled-v<version>-x86_64.AppImage` with its `.sha256` (`--out-dir DIR` writes them to DIR instead of `dist`). It publishes nothing.
It prints the commit it was run on and says when the working tree has uncommitted changes: release builds are made from the
committed tree.

### The AppImage runtime

The runtime is the small program at the front of every AppImage that mounts it and starts AppRun. The project builds its
own from the upstream [AppImage/type2-runtime](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime) source, because the released
runtime stops when FUSE cannot mount the AppImage (see [Steam Beta and the AppImage](#steam-beta-and-the-appimage)):

- `patches/appimage-runtime/baseline.env` pins the upstream commit (`dd6cebe`, tag `20251108`, the revision of the
  runtime the project used before), the Alpine 3.21.0 root file system the build runs in, and the SHA-256 of the
  reviewed result.
- `patches/appimage-runtime/0001-extract-and-run-when-fuse-fails.patch` is the whole change: when the FUSE mount fails
  the runtime uses its own extract-and-run code instead (the one `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN` selects); each run gets a
  private extraction folder, termination signals reach the game, and the folder is really removed afterwards
  (upstream's cleanup does nothing on the musl build, whose `nftw` ignores a descriptor limit of 0).
- `tools/build-appimage-runtime.sh` fetches that commit, checks it, applies the patch and runs upstream's own chroot
  build (needs root or sudo, git, tar and network access). The result is checked (type 2 magic, static, the version
  string) and compared with the pinned SHA-256; with the same Alpine packages two builds give identical files. If the
  checksum differs, packaging stops: review the new build and update `RUNTIME_SHA256`. `--check FILE` verifies a runtime or
  a finished AppImage.

A build prints, and saves next to the runtime as `<runtime>.manifest`, what produced it: the upstream commit, the patch's SHA-256,
the Alpine version, the compiler, linker and library package versions apk resolved, and the runtime's SHA-256. The runtime's
static components and their licenses are listed in `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES-LINUX.txt` inside the AppImage.

The runtime is rebuilt only when the pins or the patch change. Set `VERBOSE=1` when starting an AppImage to see which path it
took: a message appears when it falls back to extracting.

For a plain build without packaging, with the SDK extracted into `tools/rexglue/linux-amd64`, `tools/build.sh`
(`release`, `relwithdebinfo` or `debug`) builds the patched ReXGlue libraries when they are missing or out of date and
then the `linux-amd64-<config>` preset into `out/build/<preset>`. Building a preset directly works too, but stops if
the SDK does not hold the patched libraries.
